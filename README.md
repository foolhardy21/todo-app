# [ToDo App](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

## What is it ?
This is an application where user can save the projects and it's respective sub-tasks using a form.

### Overview
It follows a design pattern of ES6 Module where every component displayed on window as its own module with its own methods. This same pattern allows us to encapsulate the data. 

Two different components are projects and tasks. Task is a subset of project where a single project can have multiple tasks. These tasks can be viewed by hovering over the project.

User can create or delete the projects and tasks.

## Tech Used

- localStorage as data storage.
- webpack as a bundler.
- ES6 module pattern.
- SCSS as a CSS preprocessor. 

### Running the application

To run this app, install the dependencies using `npm install`. You can simply open the index.html in your browser. Mkae sure to run `npm run build` in case you make any changes to the code.
